                <p>This project was for an organization nested within the University of Michigan's Department of Surgery. I designed and developed this over the course of one year with the occasional assistance of a content writer.</p>
                <p>For the curious, here's a pic of my information architecture for organizing the entire department, but today I'm just going to show you how I designed and developed the Morphomics site.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <hr class="story">
                <p>To create the Morphomics site, there were a few exciting challenges that required me to turn up my problem-solving game&#58;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Pioneers in the Field.</b> This cutting-edge precision medicine research has never been done before, therefore there are no similar sites that I could draw inspiration from.</li>
                    <li><b>Lots of Medical Jargon.</b> Organizing the content that was filled with medical jargon without a background in medicine.</li>
                    <li><b>Organizational Issues</b> The site needed to include a few other projects that were strongly related to Morphomics, yet were completely separate entities.</li>
                    <li><b>Branding Problems.</b> I had to create this site with it's own distinct branding, yet still be a part of the overall University of Michigan brand.</li>
                    <li><b>A Team of One.</b> There were no other designers or developers in my department to critique my work or check my code.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These challenges made this project difficult, but not impossible.</p>

                <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
                <hr class="story">
                    <p>To get to the value of Morphomics, I asked Dr. Wang (the head of the department) what types of problems his Morphomics research solved. He had quite a few answers, but I'll list three here to give you the gist&#58;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helps auto engineers understand the bodily differences in a population to make vehicles safer.</li>
                        <li>Characterizes the variation in a population, enabling the design of better medical devices.</li>
                        <li>More precise evaluation of a patient for drug dosing and measurement of treatment success.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>All of these solutions help solve a common problem&#58; <b>Current medical and engineering practices are based on one type of human body (the 6'0 180lb male) and a lot of guesswork. This results in a needless loss of life.</b></p>
                <p>Morphomics solves this problem by showing us the exact body measures and variability in a population. This removes guessing and allows precise treatment for specific body types which saves time, money, and lowers risks for patients.</p>

                <div class="block-text thirty-five margin-left">
                    <p>I began asking around the department WHO would want to learn about Morphomics and WHY. My notes are to the left.</p>
                    <p>My idea was to organize the information based on cross-referencing the content we had with our audience&#39;s needs. I worked with members of our department who interacted directly with our audience to get this data.</p>
                    <p>From making this cross-sectional table, I learned that the most in-demand piece of information we could offer to our Morphomics audience were the CT scans of trauma patients (highlighted  in pink to the left). I learned later through user testing that <b>what they actually wanted was the data from the CT scans, not the scans themselves.</b></p>
                </div>
                <p>Later I organized all of my audience research into this neat table.</p>

                <p>I worked with Dr. Wang (the department head), June (the project manager) and Kristen (the content writer) to get this nailed down. Together we went over everything a user would want out of Morphomics.</p>

                <div class="block-text thirty margin-left">
                    <p>This was my very first mockup of the home page.</p>
                    <p>My plan was to have a JavaScript slideshow front and center that changed images every couple of seconds, each with its own Morphomics use case. The idea was to give a snapshot of the value of this research, even if the user only stayed on this page for a few seconds.</p>
                    <p>Right underneath that, I thought we'd describe what Morphomics actually is, in order to educate curious new users.</p>
                    <p>Then I listed the three projects that were spawned from Morphomics -- RAMP (Reference Analytic Morphomics Population), MAG (Morphomics Analysis Group), and MSHOP (Michigan Surgical and Health Optimization Program).</p>
                    <p>I followed that with the Resources section, which I assumed would be useful to a user who just wanted a snapshot of what we offer.</p>
                    <p>Then finally, the call to action&#58; Let&#39;s Collaborate. This is what the department wanted from medical and auto audiences -- their biometrics data.</p>

                <p class="margin-top">Below you can see how I created a low-fidelity mockup for the entire information architecture. You can see a more fleshed out version of the Morphomics homepage is at the bottom-center.</p>
                <p>I mapped out user journeys with red thread to find out which pages would be viewed the most, and thus, which ones I needed to spend the most time on.</p>

                <p>The challenge here was that I was anchored with University of Michigan branding, so I had to make sure whatever colors I chose fit in with maize, blue, and the block M.</p>

                <div class="block-text twenty-five margin-left">
                    <p>I chose this color pallet because I noticed the dull blue/green in a lot of medical microscopy. Perfect for a precision medicine site, or so I thought.</p>
                    <p>I created the Morphomics logo based on a constant in  all of our CT scans -- the vertebrae. Traced and abstracted, it even forms a vague &#34;M.&#34;</p>
                    <p>Our department gets its data is by examining CT scans in a spinal stack, so I stacked the simplified vertebrae M shapes on top of each other to create a meaningful logo.</p>

                    <p>A snapshot of my early html and css. Don’t look at it too long, your eyes might burn out. </p>

                    <p>At the time, I was still a beginner when it came to web development, so I made (and later fixed) a lot of mistakes with this site, including&#58;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The source images were too big and changed the dimensions in the CSS, slowing down the load time</li>
                        <li>Made all of my icons .svg files, which was a nightmare when it came to making the site responsive (forces the browser to re-draw them at every screen width, slowing the site down to a crawl)</li>
                        <li>Repeated myself a lot in the CSS, making finding and changing things difficult</li>
                        <li>Did not comment my code nearly as much as I should have</li>
                        <li>Repeated my JavaScript in every html document instead of linking to a .js file</li>
                        <li>Made margins and padding in pixels instead of em&#39;s
                        <li>Set image sizes to pixels instead of percentages, making reformatting for smaller-sized screens tedious</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The list could go on and on. Just know that after a few weeks in this quagmire, I fixed all of these, and made it work how I intended across all modern browsers and device sizes (even IE11 on the hospital's core-imaged machines).</p>
                    <p>My first prototype ended up looking like this&#58;</p>

                    <p>I pushed it to my Raspberry Pi and then shared the link with various users in our department: med students, researchers, and surgeons. They gave me valuable feedback, including&#58;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"It's too big."</li>
                        <li>"The menu and title take up too much space"</li>
                        <li>"The value statement is hidden below the page fold."</li>
                        <li>"We need to have more obvious U-M branding."</li>
                        <li>"So... what exactly is Morphomics?"</li>
                        <li>"We need to encourage people to collaborate with us more."</li>
                        <li>"Dr. Wang needs a biography page to show how the department developed."</li>
                        <li>"We need to tie this in with all of the other research Dr. Wang has done."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And then I showed it to Dr. Wang. I had a hover effect on the buttons that changed them from a subtle green to a bright red. He clicked around for a few minutes, and I noticed that he wasn’t getting the visual cue from hovering over the buttons.</p>
                    <p>"What color is this?" he asked.<br>"Red." I answered<br>"Oh! I can't see that. I'm red/green colorblind!"</p>
                    <p>After that, I found out that <b>It's highly common for surgeons to be red/green colorblind.</b> And surgeons were a major part of my audience, so I needed to rework the branding.

                <p>Based on the user feedback, I made the menu smaller and added some icons to it. I also made the value statement above the page fold.</p>

                <p class="margin-top">I applied this new branding to our Morphomics data pages (one of which you see below) and gave that series of pages a clean, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knolling">Knolling</a> look.</p>

                    <p>It was important that these data pages received the most design attention because according to Google Analytics, they were the most visited pages on the entire site.</p>
                    
                    <p>I wrote some JavaScript that lets the user interact with the form on this page to find the values from the chart on the left. Each Data Lookup calculator runs on a different set of values depending on which measure the user chooses (AP Body Depth @L4, Trabecular BMD @T10, etc). This makes interacting with our data very easy for researchers.</p>

                <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
                <hr class="story">
                <p>After I updated the branding on Morphomics, I installed a Heatmap plugin to see how effective it was and where exactly my users were clicking. I let it run for about a month.</p>
                <img src="images/stu/morphomics-mockup-2-heatmap.png">
                <p>This data told me a few things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Users were clicking on the "back" button on the slideshow a lot, which meant I needed to slow down the slide changing speed.</li>
                    <li>They wanted to know more details about the text floating on the slideshow, as they were clicking on that black box quite a bit</li>
                    <li>A larger-than-expected number of users were clicking on the "about" link in the menu, meaning that they wanted to know what Morphomics actually was.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>The homepage was doing its job; it was getting their attention and making them curious.</b></p>
